Shape Suite
-----------

first part: geometry, braid
0. Borotega
1. 01peal
2. 02walk (02walk_foo2)
3. triSq2.wav triang and square
4. circled (circle)
5. 05allAbove.wav (bbperm\*)

second part: xxx
exercise: make it.
Here are my guidelines:
6. Should decompose whole songs in their Fourier
components and use them separatelly as voices,
boudaries, harmonies... As an organ..
Ex: add them progressivelly in different ways.
Maybe take care to enhance the passage from sinusoids
to something different.
Take advantage of the first five pieces
7. Data sonification: my facebook network and of the ppl
on losd. Voice ppl names.
Voice text from youtube videos with:
https://github.com/nficano/pytube
and reproduce the video's audio overlayed with the espeak synth.
8. Steven's law to pitches. Octaves with base 3 not 2.
Permutation of the vibtrato, tremolo, FM and AM indexes and
modulator frequencies.
Noises (colored, etc).
Fades, climax, rhythms, scales and chords.
Maybe use sequences from IEFS.

As example solutions, and preliminary outline of the procedures
for the exercise, the pieces are started at:
6. 06sineCinderelaFourierRapunzel.py
7. 07socialFlower.py
8. 08aboutStevenWeberAndFechner.py

X. 03walk\_ (02walk_foo\_)


Passacaglia:
  bbpermX6_100b_E.wav
  bbpermX6_200_E.wav

bbpermX6_100b_E in a low volume is a really interesting sound scape.

Piece:
  Start with bbpermX4.wav alone. Mix with bass
  and present bbpermX4b.wav (and \_E).
  Then play with other bbperms, borotega.
  Make in Mass, audacity, ardour or snd?



" :Todo make the videos for the suite following the lines in the
